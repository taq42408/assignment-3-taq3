#### Hi! My name is Anna and I am a PhD candidate in the field of Plant Breeding and Genetics. Originally, I am from Roetgen, Germany. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of Duesseldorf and my Master's degree in Crop Sciences from the University of Bonn. During my studies, I also spent some time at Michigan State University and Oxford University. In 2019, I moved to Ithaca, NY, to start my program at Cornell. Since I love all the places I have lived, below I am sharing a few photos for you.

* My hobbies include rock climbing, cycling, hiking, and gardening
* My favorite flowers are Carnations
